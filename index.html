		    <div class="writing-content">
                <p class="writing_reflection">As an analytical thinker, my writing skills reflect that through technical knowledge and logical reasoning. I tend to structure my writing and keep a strong sense of organization throughout, as a way to ensure that the logical sense of the argument follows through. My personal writing skills allow me to present my thoughts clearly and concisely, which I believe to be one of the most effective ways to communicate efficiently. This also allows me to use other people's works and properly credit and source them to increase credibility and sensibility in the argument. However, my analytical writing style tends to discourage me from injecting creativity and personality into my writing. Since there is such a strong emphasis on logic and reasoning, my own personal commentary seems out of place in such a writing. As a way to develop a more free-flowing writing style, I have been exploring more styles of writing. Although approaching writing from a more story-telling perspective seems out of place for me, it is essential to find a deeper connection to both the writing and the reader. Overall, my analytical writing skills allow me to flourish in areas that I enjoy, such as finance and data analytics. I know that there is more that I can learn, however, to become a more well-rounded writer.

                <p>
                In the Data Tracking activity, I chose to focus on the historical stock price and volume of the biggest company in the world: Apple. nearly every American has an apple product, from an IPhone to a Macbook to even the streaming service AppleTV. I chose to focus on this data set in particular, because I am a finance major who is heavily invested in the stock market as well as Apple itself. The data can be spliced according to the year, and the graph can be drilled down to reveal more descriptive statistics for pertaining periods. As an avid user of the companies product as well as a shareholder, I decided that taking the data for Apple would be a good decision given the financial and everyday application the company provides. This dataset allows us to closely examine Apple since inception, which gives us a big picture look at both the Micro and Macroeconomic factors that have affected the company. A simple examination of the dataset provides a clear picture as to what the economy and company were like during certain periods, which can then be modeled and forecasted for the future using a technique like Monte Carlo Simulations. One example of this can be discovered when examining the stock during the 2008 financial crisis, where the share price of Apple went from $5.92 to $2.54, a clear indication of market turbulance during an economic catastrophe. <b class="orange"> As an individual who primarily wants to use data analytics to analyze financial markets, this data tracking assignment acted as an excellent segway to display what I want to do in my future career.  </b>

                <p class="writing_reflection">In the past, I had a lot of trouble speaking in front of a public audience. I would obsess over the small details, and become fearful up until the point that I would have to go up and present. After presenting, a wave of relief would wash over me, and I would forget all the anxiety I had felt. That is, up until the point of my next presentation. During my first year of college, I had to take a Business Scholars class at the University of Utah. In this class, we were expected to work as groups to create presentations every two weeks. Because of this high volume of presentations, I had no time to build up anxiety or worry about how it was going to play out. After this class, I was finally able to publicly speak without abnormal fear or anxiety. Because of this class and many other experiences throughout my time in college, my public speaking skills have improved dramatically. In the business communication class, we were able to demonstrate our skill in a presentation covering one of the UN’s world goals. This presentation was a crucial part of the course, and it provided the first true experience to practice speaking skills in front of a live audience of our peers. The presenting experience was overall very useful and informative in learning how people speak and react to presentations.</p>

I would also like to work more on the physical aspects of presenting, such as: voie infleciton, hand motions, and eye contact. <br><br> Overall, this project was a good experience that taught us lessons about world health issues and public speaking.

We rehearsed the presentation on zoom, and planned for the final presentation without ever having met in person to rehearse.

In class, we interacted in multiple peer activities, mostly revisions of others' works. Giving and receiving feedback was a crucial way to develop my own critical thinking skills, as well as practice effective horizontal communication. This class has shown that professional development is a collaborative process that requires multiple facets of learning and growth. I will continue to use constructive criticism and feedback as a way to improve my personal attributes. In this section, we will explore the Quinncia activity, which benefited my professionalism greatly. The service provided in depth AI resume reviews, as well as a review on a mock interview. Both of these skills are essential for creating opportunity in the business world. This also helped me identify my strengths and weaknesses, and primarily the areas I need to focus in. Additionally, the linkedIn Learning Certifications were a fantastic tool to build a baseline of professional skills and communicate that to whoever sees them. This class provided a great baseline to start building my professional career, through networking information, job application preparation, and personal development through peer revisions and collaboration.</p>

                The feedback recieved in class was imperitive to growing the professional development of each student. One of the most important skills to learn in the workplace is how to give and recieve constructive critisism. Everyone is going to recieve some form of constructive criticism in their line of work, and it is essential to know how to use that knowledge to modify your current situation. Additionally, It is just as important to be able to give constructive criticism to properly aid your fellow employees and people around you. It is far more essential to practice these skills in a non threatening enviornment, rather than a job where there can be far more dire consequences for improper interpretation of expression of criticism. The Quinncia activities also provided essential forms of feedback, from the interactive mock interview to the resume review. Both gave written feedback that described areas of strengths and weaknesses. This was important to show the user what was properly executed, and what could use further improvement.
